\title{Split data by a range of methods.}
\usage{
splt(data, n, method = "n_dist", col = NULL, force_equal = FALSE,
  allow_zero = FALSE, descending = FALSE, randomize = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe or Vector.}

\item{n}{Number of groups, group size, step size or number to start at
(depending on chosen method)
Given as whole numbers or percentage (\code{0} < n < \code{1}).}

\item{method}{\code{greedy, n_dist, n_fill, n_last, n_rand, or staircase}.

 Notice: examples are sizes of the generated groups
 based on a vector with 57 elements.

 \code{greedy} divides up the data greedily given a specified group size
 \eqn{(e.g. 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 7)}.

 \code{n_dist} divides the data into a specified number of groups and
 distributes excess data points across groups
 \eqn{(e.g. 11, 11, 12, 11, 12)}.

 \code{n_fill} divides the data into a specified number of groups and
 fills up groups with excess data points from the beginning
 \eqn{(e.g. 12, 12, 11, 11, 11)}.

 \code{n_last} divides the data into a specified number of groups.
 The algorithm finds the most equal group sizes possible,
 using all data points. Only the last group is able to differ in size
 \eqn{(e.g. 11, 11, 11, 11, 13)}.

 \code{n_rand} divides the data into a specified number of groups.
 Excess data points are placed randomly in groups (only 1 per group)
 \eqn{(e.g. 12, 11, 11, 11, 12)}.

 \code{l_sizes} divides the data by a list of group sizes.
 Excess data points are placed in extra group at the end.
 \eqn{(e.g. n = c(0.2,0.3) outputs groups with sizes (11,17,29))}.

 \code{l_starts} starts new groups at specified values of vector.
 \code{n} is a list of starting positions.
 Skip values by c(value, skip_to_number) where skip_to_number is the nth appearance of the value
 in the vector.
 Lists automatically starts from first data point.
 \eqn{(e.g. n = list(1,3,7,25,50) outputs groups with sizes (2,4,18,25,8))}.
 To skip:\eqn{(given vector c(1,2,3,1,2,3), n = list(1,2,c(3,2))
 outputs groups with sizes (1,4,1))}.

 \code{staircase} uses step_size to divide up the data.
 Group size increases with 1 step for every group,
 until there is no more data
 \eqn{(e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 7)}.

 \code{primes} uses prime numbers as group sizes.
 Group size increases to the next prime number
 until there is no more data.
 \code{n} is the prime number to start at.
 \eqn{(e.g. 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 4)}.}

\item{col}{Name of column with values to match in method \code{l_starts}
when data is a dataframe. Pass 'index' to use rownames. (Character)}

\item{force_equal}{Create equal groups by discarding excess data points.
Implementation varies between methods. (Logical)}

\item{allow_zero}{Whether n can be passed as \code{0}. (Logical)}

\item{descending}{Change direction of method. (Not fully implemented)
(Logical)}

\item{randomize}{Randomize the grouping factor (Logical)}
}
\value{
List of splitted data
}
\description{
Divides data into groups by a range of methods.
 Splits data by these groups.

\examples{
# Attach packages
library(groupdata2)
library(dplyr)

# Create dataframe
df <- data.frame("x"=c(1:12),
 "species" = rep(c('cat','pig', 'human'), 4),
 "age" = sample(c(1:100), 12))

# Using splt()
df_list <- splt(df, 5, method = 'n_dist')
